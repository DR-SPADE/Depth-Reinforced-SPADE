# Depth Reinforced SPADE for Semantic Image Synthesis

## Installation

Clone this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DR-SPADE/Depth-Reinforced-SPADE.git
```

This code requires PyTorch 1.0 and python 3+. Please install dependencies by
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This code also requires the Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch rep.
```
cd models/networks/
git clone https://github.com/vacancy/Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch
cp -rf Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch/sync_batchnorm .
cd ../../
```

## Dataset Preparation

There are different modes to load images by specifying `--preprocess_mode` along with `--load_size`. `--crop_size`. There are options such as `resize_and_crop`, which resizes the images into square images of side length `load_size` and randomly crops to `crop_size`. `scale_shortside_and_crop` scales the image to have a short side of length `load_size` and crops to `crop_size` x `crop_size` square. To see all modes, please use `python train.py --help` and take a look at `data/base_dataset.py`. By default at the training phase, the images are randomly flipped horizontally. To prevent this use `--no_flip`.


## Training New Models

New models can be trained with the following commands.

1. Prepare dataset. To train on the datasets shown in the paper, you can download the datasets and use `--dataset_mode` option, which will choose which subclass of `BaseDataset` is loaded. For custom datasets, the easiest way is to use `./data/custom_dataset.py` by specifying the option `--dataset_mode custom`, along with `--label_dir [path_to_labels] --image_dir [path_to_images]`. You also need to specify options such as `--label_nc` for the number of label classes in the dataset, `--contain_dontcare_label` to specify whether it has an unknown label, or `--no_instance` to denote the dataset doesn't have instance maps.

2. Train.

```bash
# To train on the Facades or COCO dataset, for example.
python train.py --name [experiment_name] --dataset_mode facades --dataroot [path_to_facades_dataset]
python train.py --name [experiment_name] --dataset_mode coco --dataroot [path_to_coco_dataset]

# To train on your own custom dataset
python train.py --name [experiment_name] --dataset_mode custom --label_dir [path_to_labels] -- image_dir [path_to_images] --label_nc [num_labels]
```

There are many options you can specify. Please use `python train.py --help`. The specified options are printed to the console. To specify the number of GPUs to utilize, use `--gpu_ids`. If you want to use the second and third GPUs for example, use `--gpu_ids 1,2`.

To log training, use `--tf_log` for Tensorboard. The logs are stored at `[checkpoints_dir]/[name]/logs`.

## Testing

Testing is similar to testing pretrained models.

```bash
python test.py --name [name_of_experiment] --dataset_mode [dataset_mode] --dataroot [path_to_dataset]
```

Use `--results_dir` to specify the output directory. `--how_many` will specify the maximum number of images to generate. By default, it loads the latest checkpoint. It can be changed using `--which_epoch`.

## Code Structure

- `train.py`, `test.py`: the entry point for training and testing.
- `trainers/pix2pix_trainer.py`: harnesses and reports the progress of training.
- `models/dual_model.py`: creates the networks, and compute the losses
- `models/networks/`: defines the architecture of all models
- `options/`: creates option lists using `argparse` package. More individuals are dynamically added in other files as well. Please see the section below.
- `data/`: defines the class for loading images and label maps.

## Options

This code repo contains many options. Some options belong to only one specific model, and some options have different default values depending on other options. To address this, the `BaseOption` class dynamically loads and sets options depending on what model, network, and datasets are used. This is done by calling the static method `modify_commandline_options` of various classes. It takes in the`parser` of `argparse` package and modifies the list of options. For example, since COCO-stuff dataset contains a special label "unknown", when COCO-stuff dataset is used, it sets `--contain_dontcare_label` automatically at `data/coco_dataset.py`. You can take a look at `def gather_options()` of `options/base_options.py`, or `models/network/__init__.py` to get a sense of how this works.
